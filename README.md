# PlotlyDeploy

This assignment was designed to deploy visualizations about belly button bacteria data onto a webpage. The goal is to determine from the participating subjects what are the most common bacteria found in a belly button and which bacteria could potentially be used to develop a synthetic beef. The visualized data will help to show which species of bacteria were found in the belly button and which were the most common.
